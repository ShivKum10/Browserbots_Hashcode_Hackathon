For Amazon:
- Product names are usually in h2 tags with class containing "s-line-clamp"
- Prices are in span tags with class "a-price-whole"
- Ratings are in span tags with "a-icon-alt"
- Links: Look for 'a' tags with href containing '/dp/' followed by 10 characters (ASIN code)
  Example: /dp/B08XYZ1234 or https://www.amazon.in/dp/B08XYZ1234
- CRITICAL: Every product MUST have a link with '/dp/' in it
Look for data-asin attributes for product identification.

For Flipkart:
- Product names are in "a" tags or div with class "_4rR01T" or "IRMWrR"
- Prices are in div with class "_30jeq3" or "_1_WHN1"
- Ratings are in div with class "_3LWZlK"
- Links: Look for 'a' tags with href, usually containing '/p/itm' or starting with '/'
  Example: /product-name/p/itm123456 or full URL

- Ratings are in div with class "product-rating" or "product-ratingsContainer"
- Links: CRITICAL - Links are in 'a' tags wrapping the product. Look for hrefs like:
  * Relative: /12345678/brand-name-product-name
  * Absolute: https://www.myntra.com/12345678/product-name
  * Pattern: Usually starts with a product ID (6-8 digits) followed by product slug

USER SEARCH: "{search_query}"

{site_hint}

HTML CONTENT:
{html_snapshot[:15000]}

TASK: Extract EXACTLY 5 products that match the search query (or as many as available, minimum 3). For each product, extract:
1. name: Full product title/name (string)
2. price: Price as a NUMBER ONLY (no currency symbols, no commas). Example: 1999 or 1999.50
3. rating: Rating as string (e.g., "4.5") or "N/A" if not found
4. link: Product URL - MUST be either:
   - Absolute URL starting with https://
   - Relative path starting with / (like /12345/product-name or /dp/ASIN123)

CRITICAL RULES FOR LINKS:
- For Myntra: Look for 'a' tags that wrap the entire product card. The href will look like "/12345678/product-name"
- For Amazon: Must contain '/dp/' followed by 10-character ASIN
- For Flipkart: Usually contains '/p/' or '/itm'
- If you see an 'a' tag with href attribute near the product, that's likely the link
- NEVER return empty links or links without '/' or 'http'
- When in doubt, look for the parent 'a' tag that wraps product elements

VALIDATION:
- Price MUST be numeric only (integer or float)
- Link MUST be present and valid (either absolute URL or relative path starting with /)
- If you cannot find a clear price OR valid link, skip that product
- Only return products relevant to "{search_query}"
- EVERY product must have: name, price, AND link
